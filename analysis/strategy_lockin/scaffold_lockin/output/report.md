# Pilot Study: cross-scaffold method audit

## Core finding

Across all seven shared benchmarks, all four shared base models, and the same
10-hour single-H100 budget, the two scaffolds do not converge on the same
supervised fine-tuning implementation.

Among Claude's identifiable initial methods, Full SFT accounts for 163/202
(80.7%); among Codex's identifiable initial methods, LoRA/PEFT accounts for
268/299 (89.6%).

The direction is consistent: in 28/28 matched cells Claude leans towards Full
SFT, and in 28/28 cells Codex leans towards PEFT; the mean gaps are 71.7 and
72.9 percentage points respectively.

In the Qwen3-1.7B-Base slice, the one closest to our controlled baseline,
Claude's Full SFT commands are 123/148 (83.1%), and Codex's PEFT commands are
300/349 (86.0%).

Final accuracy is the mean over trajectories that trained and produced a valid
final accuracy. It is interpretable only within a benchmark: it is not
aggregated across benchmarks and is not a causal estimate of the scaffold's
effect. The denominator of the dominant-method share is the set of identifiable
methods, so the table also reports method-labelled commands / verified training
commands coverage.

## Interpretation

The result separates two layers. At the objective layer both scaffolds
concentrate heavily on supervised likelihood; at the update-mechanism layer they
concentrate on Full SFT and LoRA/PEFT respectively. If task demand alone
determined the reasonable strategy, matched task cells should push both
scaffolds towards the same implementation mechanism. The stable opposing
preferences we observe are therefore not consistent with that simple account,
and are better predicted by scaffold-specific priors or default tooling habits.

This evidence remains observational rather than causally identified: agent
model, interface, prompt and scaffold are not independently randomised, and the
method labels do not cover every training command. The conclusion should be
stated as `inconsistent with a task-demand-only account` or `suggestive of
scaffold-specific priors`, not as `proves scaffold causality`.

## Measurement layers

- `Dominant initial method`: the first identifiable method-family label in each
  trajectory that trained.
- `Dominant command method`: training episodes that contain a training action
  and whose method family is identifiable.
- `Objective switches`: switches between adjacent identified experiments at the
  canonical objective layer. Full SFT and PEFT are both supervised likelihood,
  so swapping one for the other is not an objective switch.
- `Final accuracy`: the mean over trajectories that trained and produced a valid
  final accuracy, reported per benchmark.
